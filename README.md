### Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

### Description
In this project, I used python to build an application that let's you select a city, month, and day of the week to review a data analysis of the selected city. For example, you can see the most popular bike route, the average travel time, the most popular travel time, plus more! 

### Files used
* bikeshare.py
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

### Credits
